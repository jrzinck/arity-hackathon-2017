# Arity Hackathon 2017
Application for the 2017 Arity Hackathon

TrafiCop is a simple mapping application that uses Arity risk assessment APIs to give a location or trip a risk-score.
It then translates the calculated risk-score into a color-coding and overlays it on top of a Google Maps implementation.


To Run:

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run start`
5. look for the application running on localhost:8080

Thanks!
